# Livestock Price Prediction System

This repository contains a Python-based machine learning system for predicting livestock prices using historical market data and advanced trend analysis. The system employs a Random Forest Regressor, feature engineering, and statistical analysis to deliver accurate predictions along with confidence intervals.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data, including handling missing values and generating advanced trend-based features.
- **Trend Analysis**: Performs comprehensive market trend analysis, including momentum, seasonal patterns, and volatility metrics.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates features such as moving averages, price momentum, seasonal strength, and price trends.
- **Model Training**: Trains a Random Forest Regressor using a combination of engineered features and raw market data.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provides predictions with confidence intervals derived from the ensemble model.
- **Market Regime Detection**: Identifies market trends as bullish or bearish based on moving averages.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`
- `logging`

The script provides:

Training metrics (RMSE, RÂ²)
Detailed market trend analysis
Predictions with confidence intervals for new data
Code Structure
LivestockPricePredictor: Main class for trend analysis, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
calculate_trend_features(df): Generates advanced trend features.
analyze_market_trends(start_date, end_date): Performs market analysis over a specified date range.
train(training_data): Trains the model using historical data.
predict_with_confidence(new_data): Predicts prices and generates confidence intervals.
Example Training Data
Training data should include the following columns:

date: Date of the record (datetime format).
price: Historical price of livestock.
weight: Weight of the livestock.
age: Age of the livestock.
breed: Breed of the livestock (categorical).
season: Season during the transaction (categorical: Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall).
market_location: Location of the market (categorical).
Advanced Features
Seasonal Patterns: Incorporates seasonal trends by analyzing monthly averages.
Volatility Analysis: Uses rolling standard deviation to measure price variability.
Momentum and Trend Analysis: Employs percentage changes and linear regression for trend insights.
Future Improvements
Add support for additional regression models.
Extend feature engineering to include external factors like weather and feed prices.
Develop a web-based interface for real-time predictions.
